# An Evaluation of Generative Adversarial Networks for Collaborative Filtering.
This repository was developed by [Fernando B. Pérez Maurera](https://github.com/fernandobperezm). Fernando is a Ph.D.
student at Politecnico di Milano. 

This repository contains the source code of the following articles:
* An Evaluation Study of Generative Adversarial Networks for Collaborative Filtering. Fernando Benjamín Pérez Maurera, Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema, and Paolo Cremonesi. Accepted to ECIR 2022.

See our [website](http://recsys.deib.polimi.it/) for more information on our research group. We are actively pursuing
this research direction in evaluation and reproducibility, we are open to collaboration with other researchers. Follow
our project on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Recommender-systems-reproducibility-and-evaluation)

This repo is divided in three folders:
- [evaluation-cfgan](evaluation-cfgan/README.md): Contains the implementation of CFGAN and the experiments presented in 
  the article.
- [recsys-framework](recsys-framework/README.md): Contains the implementation of baselines, hyper-parameter 
  tuning, and evaluation used in the article.
- [pdf](pdf): Contains a copy of the [submitted article](pdf/article.pdf) and 
  [additional material](pdf/additional-material.pdf)

You'll find instructions to install this project and run the experiments in the  
[README inside evaluation-cfgan](evaluation-cfgan/README.md), in fact, all commands must be run inside 
the `evaluation-cfgan` folder.
